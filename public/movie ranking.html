<h3>Train To Busan</h3>
<p>
    I liked this movie very much. Although it is an horrifying zombie movie it is filled
    with courage, father's love. The ending is so heart touching.

<h3>Karate Kid</h3>
<p>
    Its one of the movie which I can watch without any number of times. The movie talks about how we 
    can achieve our goal through hardwork, practice, patience and perseverance. I like all the characters in this movie.
